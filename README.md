A barebones WINUI3 application, with the bare minimum of code and UI functionality, to provide a modern way to sort and change the power settings on a Windows 10 machine.

Microsoft has hid, fragmented, and obfuscated core system settings and functions. The settings that are accessible through the modern menu are spread over multiple pages, with terrible UI design, nonintuitive layout, and a frustrating nonfunctional search. Often, the modern setting app will contain links to multiple legacy settings windows carried over from Windows Vista, XP, and 1995.

This project is the beginnings of a drop-in fix for the embarassing state of Windows settings - firstly, to unhide every setting that is present; secondly, to provide basic functions like search and navigation that actually works, in one unified place (like every other OS with a gui attached to it since 2001).

I thought I'd attempt to take on power settings by themselves at first, and expand to other settings as time allows. As of today, my above-stated goals are not necessarily achieved - and the code itself is as anemic as possible to produce a running UI. On the other hand, it is already significantly better than the built-in "change advanced power settings" window - which can't be resized! - if you can get it to build and run in its current state.

Some features are held back by the beta-ish nature of WINUI3. However, most of these things just need time to research, design, and implement. As a first foray into a strongly OOP UI, this has been a strange and interesting project. A note - I pretty much directly cloned the UI appearance from [Microsoft/PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys).

## Working Features

- viewing all power settings in each installed system power scheme
- viewing the power settings in a given setting group, under a given scheme
- fast search against setting names
- scheme operations: set active, rename, copy, delete, export to file, import from file
- install classic schemes (power saver, balanced, high perf, ultimate performance)
- reset installed system schemes to default schemes
- animations and notifications to indicate an operation has succeeded or failed
- refreshing application data to reflect system changes
- hotkeys to support rename, copy, delete, refresh


## Missing Features

- editable "favorites" and "frequently used" pages
- sorting settings by "simple" and "advanced" settings-types
- settings descriptors
- reorderable pages in main nav
- UI indication of which settings are for "Plugged In" mode vs. "On Battery"
- ability to reset a scheme's settings to its default scheme settings
- coherent resizing of settings cards
- initial window sizing
- units and range checking for settings
- that single pixel of black at the top of the apptitlebar


## Missing from the Codebase

- unit testing
- integration testing
- UI testing
- performance testing / resource optimization
- compatibility testing / windows versioning awareness
- performant and stable system APIs (right now it uses powershell, and parses strings from its output)
- awareness of system state-changes
- "correct" use of Windows application styles / theme awareness
- packaging
